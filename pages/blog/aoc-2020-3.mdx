For this [puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3), we're given a map of
`#` and `.`. `#` matches a tree and `.` matches an open square. The input
looks something like this:

```txt nonumber
..##.......
#...#...#..
.#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#.
..#.##.....
.#.#.#....#
.#........#
#.##...#...
#...##....#
.#..#...#.#
```

The given input is only the pattern for the whole map. The same pattern
repeats to the right many times:

```txt nonumber
..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
.#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
..#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#
.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#.#........#
#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...#.##...#...
#...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....##...##....#
.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->
```

## Part I

**Problem**: If we start at the top-left corner and move down the map with the
slope _down: 1, right: 3_ how many trees do we encounter in our path?

**Solution**: We're going to use the given slope to traverse the map and count
the number of `#` characters.

```ts
const input = `
..##.......
#...#...#..
.#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#.
..#.##.....
.#.#.#....#
.#........#
#.##...#...
#...##....#
.#..#...#.#
`.trim();

const lines = input.split('\n');

function part1() {
	let treeCount = 0;
	let col = 0;

	for (const line of lines) {
		// At some point we're going to get past the initial pattern
		// and need to modulo the col by line length to get the current
		// character
		const index = col % line.length;
		const currentChar = line[index];
		if (currentChar === '#') treeCount++;
		col += 3;
	}

	return treeCount;
}
```

**Complexity**: This code runs in linear time and constant space.

## Part II

**Prolem**: We're given a few differnet slopes. After counting the encoutered
trees for each slope, we need to multiply them together to solve this puzzle.

**Solution**: Using our solution for Part I, we can make a function that can
accept a slope and give us a tree count. We can then use that function to get
the tree counts for every slope and mulitply the results together.

The slopes are:

- Right 1, down 1
- Right 3, down 1
- Right 5, down 1
- Right 7, down 1
- Right 1, down 2

```ts
type Slope = {
	right: number;
	down: number;
};

function countTrees(lines: string[], slope: Slope) {
	let treeCount = 0;
	let right = slope.right;

	for (let down = slope.down; down < lines.length; down += slope.down) {
		const col = right % line.length;
		const currentChar = line[col];
		if (currentChar === '#') treeCount++;
	}

	return treeCount;
}

function part2() {
	const slopes: Slope[] = [
		{ right: 1, down: 1 },
		{ right: 3, down: 1 },
		{ right: 5, down: 1 },
		{ right: 7, down: 1 },
		{ right: 1, down: 2 }
	];

	return slopes
		.map((slope) => countTrees(lines, slope))
		.reduce((acc, count) => acc * count);
}
```

**Complexity**: Time complexity is O(n\*m) where _n_ is the number of lines
and _m_ is the number of slopes we have to loop through and space complexity
remains constant.
