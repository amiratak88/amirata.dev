For this puzzle we've been given a list of password policies and passwrods and
we have to determine how many passwords are valid according to their
corresponding policy.

## Example Input

```txt nonumber
1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: cccccccccccc
```

## Part I

The first and second number indicate the minimum and maximum number of times a
letter must appear in the passwrod.

This is pretty straight forward. For each line we should count how many times
the given letter appeares in the password and then check if the count is
between the two numbers. Let's take a look at the code:

```ts
const input = `
1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: cccccccccccc
`;

const lines = input.trim().split('\n');

let validCount = 0;

for (const line of lines) {
	// we can easily parse the line by using the character indices
	// in the string, no need for fancy regex

	const min = +line[0]; // the "+" symbol converts to number
	const max = +line[2];
	const letter = line[4];
	const password = line.slice(7); // slice from the 7th index to the end of the string
	const count = password
		.split('')
		.reduce((acc, curr) => (curr === letter ? acc + 1 : acc), 0); // fancy way to count the character

	// increment validCount if "count" is "valid" ğŸ˜„
	if (count >= min && count <= max) validCount++;
}
```

If you're interested in how to parse each line using regex, check out this
code snippet:

```ts
const match = line.match(/^(\d)-(\d) ([a-z]): ([a-z]+)$/);

// This won't happen with the given input but have to do this to
// satisfy TS. Alternatively we can put a "!" at the end of the
// line where we declared "match", but I would rather handle
// this case in the actual code
if (!match) continue;

// the first value in the match array is the whole matched string
// and the rest are the captured groups
const min = +match[1];
const max = +match[2];
const [, , , letter, password] = match;
```

**Complexity**: If we neglect the length of each password, this program will
run in _linear_ time (because we're looping the array once and have no nested
loops) and _constant_ space (since we're not copying anything).

## Part II

Determine how many passwords are valid if the two numbers describe the
positions (1-based) that must contain the given character, for example,
`2-9 c: cccccccccccc` is valid because the second and ninth character in the
password are "c" but `1-3 a: abcde` is invalid because the thrid character in
the password is not "a".

```ts
let validCount = 0;

for (const line of lines) {
	const match = line.match(/^(\d)-(\d) ([a-z]): ([a-z]+)$/);
	if (!match) continue;

	const firstIdx = +match[1] - 1; // Subtract 1 since arrays and strings are zero-based
	const secondIdx = +match[2] - 1;
	const [, , , letter, password] = match;

	if (password[firstIdx] === letter && password[secondIdx] === letter) {
		validCount++;
	}
}
```

**Complexity**: This script runs in _linear_ time because we have only one
loop, and _constant_ space since we're not copying/storing anything.
