title: Using Higher Order Components and Render Highjacking to Inject Props to Children
intro: In this post, I talk about how I built two HOCs (higher order components) "withClassName" and "withStyle" to help me build more composeable React components

In this post, we are going to learn how to build two HOCs (higher order components) `withClassName` and `withStyle` which use render highjacking to manipulate the wrapped components's children's props.

Take a look at the code for this simple Button component:

```tsx
type Props = {
	text: string;
	onClick: () => void;
};

const Button: React.FC<Props> = ({ children, text, onClick }) => {
	return <button className="p-3 rounded-md">{children}</button>;
};
```

Now let's say we are trying to build another component called `BlueButton` and we want to reuse our existing `Button` component to accomplish that. In order to do that, let's make our Button accept a **className** prop and pass in the appropriate class names to make this button blue.

```tsx
type Props = {
	text: string;
	onClick: () => void;
	className?: string;
};

const Button: React.FC<Props> = ({ children, text, onClick, className }) => {
	const originalClassName = 'p-3 rounded-md';
	const finalClassName = className ? `${originalClassName} ${className}`;
	return <button className="p-3 rounded-md">{children}</button>;
};
```

We can now build our `BlueButton` component:

```tsx
type Props = {
	text: string;
	onClick: () => void;
};

const BlueButton: React.FC<Props> = (props) => (
	<Button {...props} className="bg-blue-700 text-gray-300" />
);
```

That was a lot of typing. I've found this to be a recurring pattern when developing react applications. Especially for things like `margin` which in my opinion are not worth making them their own prop and they just make our code messy. So I wrote a little utility function that can do this for me. Let's take a look at the code:

```tsx
// "W" is the wrapped component and "E" is the enhanced component (what we are returning)
const withClassName = <T extends { [x: string]: any }>(W: React.FC<T>) => {
	const E: React.FC<T & { className?: string }> = ({ className, ...wrappedProps }) => {
		const elementsTree = W(wrappedProps as T);
		if (!elementsTree) return null;
		if (!className) return elementsTree;

		const newClassName = elementsTree.props.className
			? `${elementsTree.props.className} ${className}`
			: className;

		return React.cloneElement(
			elementsTree,
			{ ...elementsTree.props, className: newClassName },
			elementsTree.props.children
		);
	};

	return E;
};
```

I've used `React.cloneElement` API to inject my **className** props to the **elementsTree** resulted by rendering the wrapped component. What I like most about this is that it's type-safe which makes the composed component accept all the wrapped component's props plus the additional **className** prop. I'm accepting wrapped props as a generic type parameter **T** and returning a function component of type `React.FC<T & { className?: string; }`. Now we can build our BlueButton component without touching the Button component.

```tsx
import withClassName from 'utils/withClassName';
import _Button from 'components/Button';
const Button = withClassName(_Button);

type Props = {
	text: string;
	onClick: () => void;
};

const BlueButton: React.FC<Props> = (props) => (
	<Button {...props} className="bg-blue-700 text-gray-300" />
);
```

How clean is that?! ðŸ˜…

We can do something similar for the `style` prop. Check out the snippet below:

```tsx
// "W" is the wrapped component and "E" is the enhanced component (what we are returning)
const withStyle = <T extends { [x: string]: any }>(W: React.FC<T>) => {
	const E: React.FC<T & { style?: React.CSSProperties }> = ({ style, ...wrappedProps }) => {
		const elementsTree = W(wrappedProps as T);
		if (!elementsTree) return null;
		if (!style) return elementsTree;

		return React.cloneElement(
			elementsTree,
			{ ...elementsTree.props, style: { ...elementsTree.props.style, ...style } },
			elementsTree.props.children
		);
	};

	return E;
};
```

If you have never written you own HOC, hope this post inspires you to write one if you find a nice usecase for one. It's wroth mentioning that I have only recently started using `React.cloneElement` and not sure if this has any performance downsides, so use it at your own risk.
